Drive a bunch of pumps top make cocktails. This was an accidental entry in the DNA Lounge Cocktail Robotics competition, 2019.

In order to make it work you will need to wire up a bunch of pumps using a relay board connected to the Pi. You will also need to know the rates at which all the pumps push fluid (just time them for about 50s and see how much they pump).
